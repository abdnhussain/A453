GCSE python project

GCSE Python project to create a piece of code that will find the position of a word in a sentence and return it.  If a word is repeated, it will be given the same position as the first one.

The code also gives the options to read and write to a text file with a custom name as well as compressing the text files.  It is also user friendly, easy to use and personable so that the user is welcomed with a greeting based on the time of day and allows the user to input their own sentence or choose from a predefined one.

The different tasks are the code being built up with additional features as you move through the tasks, task 3 being the completed piece of code.  Within each task, there is a testing folder with code that gave me a specific error as well as a flowchart and phases of development of the feature and a flowchart.
