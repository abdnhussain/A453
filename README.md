GCSE python project

GCSE Python project to create a piece of code that will find the position of a word in a sentence and return it.  If a word is repeated, it
will be given the same position as the first one.

The code also gives the options to read and write to a text file with a custom name as well as compressing the text files.  It is also user
friendly, easy to use and personable so that the user is welcomed with a greeting based on the time of day and allows the user to input 
their own sentence or choose from a predefined one.
